Notes: 
10 different adam as a sanity check -> done
try sgd 
try sgdsls
modify adamSLS to work with just one backwards pass and only update step size on a single layer at a time every step done
do an initial step on all the lrs and only then let them evolve seperately -> done but kinda ugly right now
