Notes: 
think of different critertions which part of the network to update(maybe highest grad norm or smthn)
does the armijo criterion i.e. make sense for only a part of the network? maybe use the loss of the subnetwork (i.e. the gradient?) maybe by integrating the gradient on the input part of the subnetwork
seperate the network differently? (by key, query, value, mlp part) -> done needs to be tested now
understand complexity and see what it relates to in a transformer
SLS + SAM on the network
partial step should also do the step for the rest of the network just with normal step size.
try 10 adamsls on transformer pre-training
maybe try radam instead of adam
